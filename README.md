# Twenty-Chore-Seven

#### Technology

I used CSS, JavaScript, bcrypt, dotenv, AngularJS, Express, Express-session, Mongoose, and MongoDB to build this application.

#### Approach

Full CRUD app created first. Added login functionality second.

#### User Story

Parent creates account then adds accounts for their children.
Parent creates chores for each child and sets a point value.
Parent can add, edit, and delete rewards which will show up in children's "Reward Store".
Children log in to their own account to sign off on each chore they have completed.
Children will be able to go into the 'Reward Store' and redeem their points.
After child has signed off on a chore, the Parent will have to verify inside their profile before the child receives their points.

#### Notes

I want to add a 'Rewards Store' so the children can see what rewards they can work towards and ultimately redeem their points for the rewards which will alert the parent of their purchases.
